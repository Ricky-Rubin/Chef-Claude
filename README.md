# Chef-Claude

This Chef Claude project is part of a React course on [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com).  
The project focuses on building an AI-powered recipe recommendation app where users can input ingredients and receive a suggested recipe from an integrated AI model. It helps learners strengthen their knowledge of **React state management, event listeners, conditional rendering, props, form handling, API integration,** and the use of external libraries in a React environment.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: for creating the structure of the app  
- **CSS**: for styling and ensuring a clean, user-friendly interface  
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: for functionality and event handling  
- **React**: for building UI components and managing state  
- **API + AI Integration**: to fetch recipes from an AI-powered endpoint based on user-input ingredients

## Features

- **Ingredient Input Tab**: Users can add ingredients into the input field to build their list  
- **Conditional Recipe Button**: A dedicated button for recipe recommendation appears once at least 4 ingredients are entered  
- **AI-powered Recipe Generation**: The app uses an AI model through an API call to provide a recipe suggestion  
- **React Concepts in Action**: Demonstrates usage of React state, props, event listeners, conditional rendering, and form behavior
